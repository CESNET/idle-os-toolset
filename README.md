# IDLE-OS-TRAFFIC Toolset

A toolset for capturing network traffic of various operating systems (OS) in idle state.
It allows to easily create and run a virtual machine (VM) with given OS image and capture the traffic it generates by itself, with no user interaction (such as connectivity tests or checks for updates).

The captured data are intended to support research of passive OS fingerprinting methods.

A dataset created using these tools will be publised soon (TODO link) ...
